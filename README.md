# Motion Table Doodles

This repo is just a collection of doodles I made recreating motions from the [Periodic Table of Motion](http://foxcodex.html.xdomain.jp/index.html).

These doodles are made in [PICO-8](pico-8.com). You will need a license to look at the source. Otherwise feel free to do with them as you wish
